The heading font is ‘Dancing Script’

## *General Styling*
The Navbar and Footer are uniform across the web app allowing easy navigation.
The Navbar allows the user to move from page to page and the Footer displays the links to the company’s social media.
The shop pages have cards displaying the cakes with the ability to add the cakes to the shopping cart.
In the checkout, the customer is able to “purchase” the items in their shopping cart either adding their address or using one they have already entered.
Users are able to create an account, save their address details and see their orders as well as making “purchases”.
